      <h2>Segovia's Legacy</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Born on February 21, 1893 in Linares, Jaén, Spain.</li>
        <li>He was intially a violin student, but discontinued his lessons due to his strict teacher.</li>
        <li>Later moved to Granada, Spain where he would pick up the guitar for the first time.
        </li>
        <li>Was supposed to study under Francisco Tárrega, but Tárrega passed away before they could meet. Segovia was practically self-taught but studied the music of Tárrega and Fernando Sor. </li>
        <li>Segovia's first notable performance was at the age of 16. From here he would tour the world and bring popularity to the guitar.
        </li>
        <li>He was known for creating techniques involving the use of fingernails and finger tips in order to create different tones. This practice is still used in the classical guitar scene today.</li>
        <li>The legacy that Segovia left behind was one that involved teaching, his unique techniques, and making the guitar a concert hall worthy instrument. He paved the way for the guitar's future popularity.
        </li>
      </ul>
